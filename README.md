The deployment of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) on Irish roads marks a critical advancement in the nation's transportation infrastructure, aiming to enhance road safety, reduce congestion, and improve driver decision-making. Through collaboration between Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and AECOM, this project focuses on the security, privacy, and scalability challenges associated with the deployment of C-ITS services via ITS-G5 and 4G/5G cellular networks. By leveraging the European Unionâ€™s C-ITS Credential Management System (EU CCMS) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the project ensures secure communication between road users, vehicles, and infrastructure. This research will conduct a comprehensive security review of the Irish C-ITS pilot, focusing on evaluating the effectiveness of PKI implementations, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and proposing measures to improve resilience against failures and attacks. The outcomes will inform recommendations for the secure and privacy-preserving deployment of C-ITS in Ireland, contributing to the broader European C-Roads initiative for harmonized C-ITS solutions.
